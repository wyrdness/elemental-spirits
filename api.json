      "full": "Elemental spirits are supernatural beings associated with the four classical elements: earth (gnomes), air (sylphs), water (undines/nymphs), and fire (salamanders). While elemental beings appear in ancient mythologies worldwide, the formal classification was systematized by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus in the 16th century. These entities are believed to embody and control elemental forces, residing in their respective natural domains. Ancient roots include Greek nymphs, Germanic dwarfs and kobolds, and various nature spirits from global traditions. In modern times, elementals feature prominently in ceremonial magic, Theosophy, Wicca, neopaganism, and fantasy literature. They represent an enduring archetype connecting humanity to natural forces and serve as both folklore entities and occult/spiritual concepts."
