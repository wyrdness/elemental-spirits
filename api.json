While elemental beings appear in ancient mythologies worldwide, the formal classification was systematized by Swiss alchemist **Paracelsus** in the 16th century. These entities are believed to embody and control elemental forces, residing in their respective natural domains. They represent an enduring archetype connecting humanity to natural forces and serve as both folklore entities and occult/spiritual concepts."
